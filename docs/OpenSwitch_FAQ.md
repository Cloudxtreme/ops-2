## OpenSwitch Community

#### Q: Who are the core contributing parties that initiated the OpenSwitch community?
A: A current list of community members can be found at [insert openswitch.net url for membership]

#### Q: Will the OpenSwitch community be open to developers and users?
A: TBD

#### Q: Who can join the OpenSwitch community?
A: Projects in OpenSwitch are made up of many different forms of contributors. One specific example is a committer. A committer has the ability to merge code into the OpenSwitch project for which they are a member. Committer's responsibilities are outlined below. In general, projects should strive to have a healthy number of committers to ensure code is merged in a timely manner and the project is moving forward with decent feature velocity. There are no hard numbers of how many committers are required, but as the committers work closely together, experience in other projects has led us to believe they usually top out at 12-15 or so per project before requiring another layer in between the maintainer and committers.

#### Q: Will the OpenSwitch community be open to competitors of the core contributing memebers?
A: Yes. TBD

#### Q: What licensing model does OpenSwitch use?
A: TBD

#### Q: When is it realistic to expect new products based on OpenSwitch NOS?
A: TBD

#### Q: What type of products should one expect to see from this community?
A: OpenSwitch Network OS will be a fully featured network operating system with L2/L3 support protocols based on a state driven database for a persistent and ephermeral state. All inter0module communications will be through the system state database and follow a universal API approach: CLI, REST, Puppet/Chef, etc.

## The Competition

#### Q: What makes OpenSwitch different from other Linux-based operating systems?
A: TBD
